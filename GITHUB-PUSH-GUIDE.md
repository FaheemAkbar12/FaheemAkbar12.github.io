# 🚀 GitHub Push Guide - Faheem Akbar Portfolio

**Preparing your portfolio for GitHub deployment**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Files Security Clarification

### ✅ SAFE to Commit (No Secrets)

Your portfolio files are **frontend code** - they're meant to be public! These are all safe:

- **production-config.js** - Just environment detection (isDevelopment/isProduction)
  - No secrets, just checks hostname
  - Safe to commit ✅

- **error-tracking.js** - Sentry configuration
  - DSN (Data Source Name) is **designed to be public**
  - Sentry DSNs are like API endpoints, not secret keys
  - Currently has placeholder `'your-dsn'` which is safe
  - Even with real DSN, it's safe (Sentry docs confirm this)
  - Safe to commit ✅

- **backend-example.js** - Example implementations
  - Educational code showing Node.js/Python/PHP examples
  - Not used by frontend (just documentation)
  - No real credentials
  - Safe to commit ✅

- **.htaccess** - Security headers
  - Public configuration
  - Makes your site more secure
  - Safe to commit ✅

### ❌ NOT Safe to Commit (If You Create Them)

Only commit these if they exist and have real secrets:
- `.env` files with API keys
- Files with database passwords
- SSH private keys
- Actual backend server code with credentials

**Your current portfolio has NO sensitive files!** Everything can be committed.

---

## 📋 Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] Remove any test credentials you may have added
- [ ] Check if you added real Sentry DSN (still safe, but note it)
- [ ] Ensure no `.env` files with secrets exist
- [ ] Backup files removed (already in .gitignore)
- [ ] Build artifacts cleaned (dist/ in .gitignore)

**Your portfolio is ready as-is!** ✅

## 🔧 Git Setup & Push Commands

### Step 1: Check Git Status

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd U:\Projects\PORTFOLIO\faheem-akbar-portfolio

# Check if Git is initialized
git status
```

**Expected output:**
- If initialized: Shows current branch and changes
- If not: "fatal: not a git repository" → Continue to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Initialize Git (If Needed)

```powershell
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Set default branch to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Configure Git (if first time)
git config user.name "Faheem Akbar"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

---

### Step 3: Review What Will Be Committed

```powershell
# See all files that will be added
git add --dry-run .

# Or see a detailed list
git status
```

**Check the output:**
- ✅ Should include: HTML, CSS, JS, .htaccess, package.json, README.md
- ❌ Should NOT include: node_modules/, dist/, backup_*/

---

### Step 4: Add Files to Git

```powershell
# Add all files (respects .gitignore)
git add .

# Verify what's staged
git status
```

---

### Step 5: Create Initial Commit

```powershell
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Faheem Akbar Portfolio

- Production-ready portfolio with security features
- CSRF protection and rate limiting
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility
- Performance optimized (Lighthouse 93)
- Comprehensive security headers
- Directory listing disabled
- Documentation included"
```

---

### Step 6: Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: GitHub Website**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `faheem-akbar-portfolio` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Professional portfolio with enterprise security"
4. Visibility: **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
5. ⚠️ **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: GitHub CLI** (if installed)
```powershell
gh repo create faheem-akbar-portfolio --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

---

### Step 7: Connect to GitHub

```powershell
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/faheem-akbar-portfolio.git

# Verify remote added
git remote -v
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/faheem-akbar-portfolio.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/faheem-akbar-portfolio.git (push)
```

---

### Step 8: Push to GitHub

```powershell
# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

**If prompted for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use **Personal Access Token** (not account password)
  - Create token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Scopes needed: `repo` (full control)

**Alternative: SSH** (if you have SSH keys set up)
```powershell
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/faheem-akbar-portfolio.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 9: Verify on GitHub

1. Open: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/faheem-akbar-portfolio
2. Check files are present
3. Verify README.md displays correctly
4. Click around to ensure all files uploaded

---

## 🔄 Future Updates (After Initial Push)

When you make changes later:

```powershell
# Check what changed
git status

# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## 🌐 Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

Host your portfolio directly on GitHub:

### Method 1: GitHub Website
1. Go to repo Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Source: Deploy from branch
4. Branch: `main` → `/root`
5. Save

**Your site will be at:**
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/faheem-akbar-portfolio/
```

### Method 2: Custom Domain (faheemakbar.me)
1. In Pages settings, add custom domain: `faheemakbar.me`
2. In your domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.):
   - Add CNAME record: `www` → `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
   - Add A records for apex domain:
     ```
     185.199.108.153
     185.199.109.153
     185.199.110.153
     185.199.111.153
     ```
3. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
4. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub Pages settings

## 🔒 Security Notes

**What's Public on GitHub:**
- All HTML, CSS, JavaScript code (as intended)
- Documentation files
- Configuration files (.htaccess, package.json)
- Build scripts

**What's Protected:**
- node_modules/ (ignored)
- dist/ (ignored, regenerated on build)
- Backup files (ignored)
- Any .env files (ignored)

**Sentry DSN Note:**
- Sentry DSNs are **meant to be public**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution:**
```powershell
git init
git branch -M main
```

### Issue: "failed to push some refs"
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Pull first (if repo has content)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue: Authentication failed
**Solution:**
1. Use Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Or set up SSH keys: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

### Issue: Large files rejected
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check file sizes
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 50MB} | Select-Object FullName, @{Name="MB";Expression={[math]::Round($_.Length / 1MB, 2)}}

# Remove large files and add to .gitignore
git rm --cached path/to/large-file
echo "path/to/large-file" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove large file"
```
